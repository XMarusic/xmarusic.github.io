## **Contextual Meeting Segmentation using Pointer Mechanism**
I am currently working on a novel technique of contextual meeting segmentation for the task of meeting summarization using Pointer Networks. Unlike documents, meetings span over multiple topics spread throughout the course of the meeting. In order to capture the true summary of the meeting, it is important to capture the summary of each of the topics present in the meeting. The segmentation approaches existing today ignore the fact that sentences belonging to the same context can be continuous or non-continuous in nature. We solve the problem of contextual meeting segmentation using pointer mechanism to extract the related sentences from a meeting transcription without assuming that the sentences are consecutive in nature.
