I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Microsoft Indian Development Center as a part of Microsoft Search Assistant and Intelligent (MSAI). We are powering intelligent recommendations on Outlook using deep learning and data science at a scale of 30 million monthly active users. 

My research interests involve accentuating a human's visual, auditory or interactive experience through machine learning. I am excited by the projects in the domain of deep learning, virtual reality, robotic-vision and robotic-human interaction. 

I am also a musician and love to travel to different countries and experience multiple culture. YouTube link here!
