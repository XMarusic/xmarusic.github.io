1. Building a contextual ranking model for generating insights on meetings for suggesting relevant documents and emails and 
2. Meeting summarization for the task of Contextual Meeting Segmentation. 
Before joining as a full time data scientist, I worked as an intern at Microsoft on a project aimed at learning the most efficient order of questions to be asked by a bot in order to maximize human-bot interaction for different classes of users.
Broadly speaking, I am interested in the application of Machine Learning and specifically Deep Learning to the field of NLP, Computer Vision and Speech Recognition.

I received my Bachelors in Computer Science from University of Mumbai, India.
